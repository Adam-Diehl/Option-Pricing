# Option-Pricing
Option pricing algorithms in C/C++. Note that the Vanilla Heston Option BI file contains a standard implementation of the Heston option pricing model. The files contained in the 'Heston Option - Faster' folder utilize antithetic acceleration and push the program onto the stack, rather than the heap, by chunking the arrays out and is approximately 3 times faster than the standard implementation.
